About me

* Current project
* Interests and areas
* 

I am currently building data and Blockchain products in education and healthcare sectors. 

I like to build digital products, work with humanitarian tech teams and do technology speaking/workshops. Currently I am exploring Data, ML and Blockchain space and building few products.

Sometimes, I build DIY satellites and teach researchers/students on how to go about it :)
